# OpenMV Intelligent Vision Robot Arm Project

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_CN.md)

---

##  Introduction

This project is an integrated development system based on the **OpenMV vision module** and a **multi-DOF robot arm**. It integrates mechanical control, computer vision, deep learning (TFLite/FOMO), and automation algorithms. The project is designed to provide a complete hardware and software reference solution for **Engineering Makers**, **Electronic Design Contests (EDC)**, and **AI Robotics Education**.

##  Core Features

- **Vision Recognition & Positioning**: Utilizing OpenMV for color tracking, shape recognition, and TFLite deep learning model inference (e.g., FOMO).
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Establishing the mapping between camera pixel coordinates and robot arm spatial coordinates.
- **Various Scenarios**:
    - **2024 EDC Problem E**: A complete solution for Problem E (Target Control and Recognition) of the 2024 National Undergraduate Electronic Design Contest.
    - **Tic-Tac-Toe**: Intelligent gameplay combining image recognition and game algorithms.
    - **Intelligent Sorting**: Fast recognition and sorting of blocks/garbage using the FOMO model.
- **Teaching & Demo**:
    - **Teaching Mode**: Supports recording and replaying movements via buttons.
    - **Interactive Display**: Real-time display of vision feed and system status on an LCD.

##  Quick Start

### 1. Firmware Flashing
Flash the bin files in firmware/ to the robot arm control board.

### 2. Environment Setup
1. Install [OpenMV IDE](https://openmv.io/pages/download).
2. Copy files from the example directory to the OpenMV disk root.

### 3. Calibration (Crucial)
Run openmv_examples/Calibration and Testing/calibration.py to ensure proper servo alignment and coordinate mapping.
